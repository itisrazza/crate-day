          <b>Crate Day</b> is an informal national holiday in New Zealand to
          celebrate the beginning of summer and share a crate of beer with
          mates. It occurs on the first Saturday of December every year.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is celebrated by downing a crate of 12 beers hourly from 12 PM to
          12 AM on the following Sunday. The following rules are implemented.
          They are like laws, but more important.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 12 crate of beers can be substituted with a bottle of sprits. If
          you're unable to continue, your crate will be forfeited.
